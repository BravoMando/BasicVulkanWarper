# BasicVulkanWarper
A simple basic Vulkan Warper learned from [Brendan Galea](https://github.com/blurrypiano). However I made some small changes in the implementations since it's basically for Tutorial, and I'm still working on it!ðŸ¤ª

## Prerequired Tools
+ C/C++ Compiler
+ [CMake](https://cmake.org)
+ [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)

## Build&Run
### Download this repository
Start by cloning this repository. Open a terminal in your working directory and type in the following commands.
```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/BravoMando/BasicVulkanWarper.git
```
If the repository was cloned non-recursively, use the following commands to clone the necessary submodules.
```bash
    git submodule update --init
```
### Configure the dependencies

+ Windows
    + Run the [Build.bat](./Build.bat). It should automatically build the project with CMake based on your C/C++ compiler.
+ Ubuntu
    + Enter the [project root directory](./), open a terminal and type in the following commands to add permission.
    ```bash
        sudo chmod +x Build.sh
    ```
    + Then run the [Build.sh](./Build.sh), it should automatically build the project with CMake. If it says some dependencies you didn't installed, then install the dependencies and rerun the [Build.sh](./Build.sh).

## Brief Intro
I made a [Diagram Repository](https://github.com/BravoMando/BasicVulkanWarperUML) corresponding to this repository, it's more detail about the implementation, and hope it can help make a better understanding of Vulkan.
